  <h4> About Amparo</h4>
   <p> I am a UCR graudate with a BS in General Mathhematics and my interest for software development started when I took a few courses in college. I enjoy hiking and being outdoors and exploring new areas. After a stressfull work day, hiking helps keep my brain nice and sharp after a long day. I have worked as a high school tutor for all math and science departments and am efficent with working and helping others. What makes me passionate about web development is:  </p>
    <ul><li>competitiveness amongst frameworks which makes things more challenging and new.</li>
   <li>I love that there is a continuous change in web development and the need for learning is always present.</li></ul>
  
   <p> I am very excited to start working with other developers so if you're interested in challenging youself to work with a newbie, I'm your girl!</p>
